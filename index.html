      <p>
        The PHP Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is a programming language
        that allows web developers to create dynamic content that
        interacts with databases. PHP is basically used for developing
        web based software applications. This tutorial helps you to
        build your base with PHP.
      </p>
      <p>
        PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as
        more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf
        unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994. PHP is a
        must for students and working professionals to become a great
        Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web
        Development Domain.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="hello_world">
      <header>Hello World</header>
      <p>
        To get started on PHP you first have to learn how to print out the
        statement "Hello World". Printing out "Hello World" as your first
        script is used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language.
        It is often the first program written by people learning to code.
      </p>
      <p>
        PHP is embedded in HTML. That means among your HTML you'll have a PHP
        statement like this below.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          &lthtml&gt
            &lthead&gt
              &lttitle&gtHello World&lt/title&gt
            &lt/head&gt

            &ltbody&gt
              &lt?php echo "Hello, World!";?&gt
            &ltbody&gt
          &lthtml&gt
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        The following will produce
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          Hello, World!
        </code>
      </pre>

      <header>Variable Types</header>
      <p>
        The main way to store information in the middle of a PHP program is by
        using a variable. Here are the most important things to know about
        variables in PHP.
      </p>
      <p>
        PHP has a total of eight data types which we use to construct our variables.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Integers</b> are whole numbers, without a decimal point, like 4195.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Doubles</b> are floating-point numbers, like 3.14159 or 49.1.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Booleans</b> have only two possible values either true or false.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>NULL</b> is a special type that only has one value: NULL.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Strings</b> are sequences of characters, like 'PHP supports string operations.'
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Arrays</b> are named and indexed collections of other values.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Objects</b> are instances of programmer-defined classes, which can package
          up both other kinds of values and functions that are specific to the class.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Resources</b> are special variables that hold references to resources
          external to PHP (such as database connections).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="constant">
      <header>Constant</header>
      <p>
        A constant is a name or an identifier for a simple value. A constant value cannot 
        change during the execution of the script. By default, a constant is case-sensitive. 
        By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase. A constant name starts 
        with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or 
        underscores. If you have defined a constant, it can never be changed or undefined.
      </p>
      <p>
        To define a constant you have to use define() function and to retrieve the value 
        of a constant, you have to simply specifying its name. Unlike with variables, you 
        do not need to have a constant with a $. You can also use the function constant() 
        to read a constant's value if you wish to obtain the constant's name dynamically
      </p>
      <p>
        Constant Example
      </p>
        <pre>
          <code>
            &lt?php
              define("MINSIZE", 50);
      
              echo MINSIZE;
              echo constant("MINSIZE"); 
            ?&gt

      <p>
        Loops in PHP are used to execute the same block of code a specified number of times. There are four loops types that are supported by PHP.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>for </b>loops through a block of code a specified number of times.</li>
        <li><b>while </b>loops through a block of code if and as long as a specified condition is true.</li>
        <li><b>do...while </b>loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as a special condition is true.</li>
        <li><b>foreach </b>loops through a block of code for each element in an array.</li>
